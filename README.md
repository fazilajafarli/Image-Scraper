# Image-Scraper

This Python application allows you to search any terms (ex. location) and get image links and titles related to that term. It uses Google Custom Search API and Google Search Engine. 
API key, search term, then period should be entered. Google does not allow the disclosure of the API key, so the API key is hidden. The results are written in a .csv file.
